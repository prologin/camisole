camisole's documentation
========================

|project| is a **secure online judge** for code compilation and execution. You
give some untrusted source code and a test suite, and |project| compiles the
code and runs it against the test suite.

It uses isolate_ as a backend to safely compile and execute source codes using
Linux kernel features such as namespaces, cgroups, chroot and resources limits.

|project| is aimed at:

- Computer science teachers who want to **grade their students** or provide
  them with an online tool to check their own code.
- Programming contests who want to grade the submissions of the contestants
  with an **online judge**.
- Programming websites who want to have an interactive demo where people can
  **run arbitrary code**.
- Online compiler/interpreter websites.

|project| handles all major languages, and can be easily extended to support
more. The built-in languages are:

Communication with the |project| engine relies on a simple HTTP API with JSON
or MessagePack_ serialization.

You can contribute to the project development on GitHub_ by reporting issues,
making suggestions or opening pull requests.

Check out :ref:`quickstart` for a quick outlook of |project| features and usage.
